Data Generator Script
*********************

This is a python script that is written in python version 3.6
This script generates random data with help of Faker library and generates 3 files \
that are (excel, csv and json) saved in output folder inside our project folder
An input data file is provided in input folder as an example of how input file should be formatted
Logs are maintained in LOGS.log file


Prerequisites:

    1. System must have python3.6
    2. Install all the libraries required using command: pip/pip3 install -r requirements.txt
    3. *.xlsx input file that consists of 2 columns:
        i. fieldname : pass what output file's header value should be
        ii. dataType : pass the data type required to generate output 
                        (various data types are predefined in datatypes.py file)


To run this application:
    # count is iteration value to generate N number of records
    # path is file path to determine input file format, this should be excel format
    # default input file is provided in input folder as data.xlsx
    # 3 output files will be generated according to following scenarios in output folder

    1. Without parameters: python3 main.py
        Here count value is set default to 100 and an input data file will be considered from \
        input folder's data.xlsx file 

    2. With count parameter: python3 main.py count=N
        Here count value is determined by Nth value e.g count=10 and an input data file \
        will be considered from input folder's data.xlsx file 

    3. With path parameter: python3 main.py path='file_path'
        Here count value is set default to 100 and an input data file will be \
        file_path from path parameter
    
    4. With count and path parameter: python3 main.py count=N path='file_path'
        Here count value is determined by Nth value and an input data file will be \
        file_path from path parameter
    
    5. With field and data type parameters:
            python3 main.py FirstName first_name LastName last_name Email email

        Here count value is set default to 100 and output data will generate based on \
        parameter values; here all the parameters are divided into set of 2 parts \ 
        and each part cosist of 2 values:
        i. first value will be Header of output file
        ii. second value will be value generated according to specified data type 

    6. With count, field and data type parameters:
            python3 main.py count=N FirstName first_name

        Here count value is determined by Nth value and output data will generate based on \
        parameter values

    7. With count, path, field and data type parameters:
            python3 main.py count=N path='file_path' FirstName first_name

        Here count value is determined by Nth value and output data will generate based on \
        input file provided from path parameter and it will append extra field and data type \
        passed in parameters


Note : if default value is to be used for a specific field having same value for all records:
        For excel:
                append the value followed by '=' symbol after data type in excel sheet's \
                dataType column
                e.g: first_name=XYZ or name=ABC DEF or age=18
        For command line argument:
                append the value followed by 'value=' keyword after data type
                e.g: Firstname value='XYZ' or Name value='ABC DEF' or Age value=18
